Roster
==============
__Roster__ is what we made to get familiar with NodeJS as webserver in combination with Socket.IO.

## NodeJS
NodeJS tutorials, or any programming tutorial for that matter, never show how to create a proper application structure.
And because of this we used this project to try out some techniques in order to give our project more structure so it will allow us to create "bigger" applications.

## Technologies
__Roster__ uses the following technologies:

| Technology                                                    | Description                         |
